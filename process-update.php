    Very Important Note:
    --------------------
    As we have learnt before (Refer to my in-class notes for more details)
    Updating or deleting  a record from database are very danger commands for two reasons:
        - There is no Undo for this process
        - If don't specify which record we wan to update/delete, MySQL will update all the records
    
    So we should add the WHERE clause to filter/select only the required record
    As usual, we can target the wanted record by its primary key value 
    Normally, the primary key value is the id column
    */

    // Check if the form is submitted
    // we can just check if submit has a value (which means it was clicked) 
    if(isset($_POST['submit'])){
        // Extracting the values from the $_POST array ans save each one to a varaible
        // Getting the  value of the member id from the hidden field:
        $id = $_POST['memberId'];
        $fname = $_POST['firstname'];
        $lname = $_POST['lastname'];
        $dob = $_POST['dob'];
        $email = $_POST['email'];
        $phone = $_POST['phone'];
        $occupation = $_POST['occupation'];

        // Now we need to call our object "crud" and using its method updateMember() to insert the values into our database:
        // We set the method to return a boolean value:
        // - true if the update statement done!
        // - false if the update statement failed
        // so we can assign the returned value to another varaible named "isDone" for example
        // our method requires 6 arguments:
        $isDone = $crud->updateMember($id, $fname, $lname, $dob, $email, $phone, $occupation);

        if($isDone) {
            // If the update processing is done successfully
            // We can redirect the member to the member details page "show-member.php"
            // Refer to my PHP in-class code and lecture for more details to learn more about header() function
            // show-member.php => requires the member_id value to be passed through the URL 
            // We can use the same logic/code as we used before with members.php file
            /*
            So we can attach the member_id value to the link:
            1. Adding the "?" after the file name
            2. Adding any varaible name to be contain the required value that we need to pass to another page
               NOTE: in show-member.php we checking the variable "id" so we should name it "id" in this file also
            3. Assign the wanted value to that variable
            */
